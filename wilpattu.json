It is controlled by the Department of Wildlife Conservation and covers Puttalam and Anuradhapura districts, as well as Mannar and Vavuniya. The park is home to the elusive Sri Lankan leopard and sloth bear, as well as deep forest cover and the distinctive Villu wetlands. The park is near the ancient historical city of Anuradhapura and contains numerous ancient remains and artifacts. The park is famous for its leopard population, with a remote camera survey collecting images of 49 different leopards. The park was closed owing to security concerns during the Sri Lankan Civil War but reopened 16 years later. The park's history goes back to 543 BC when Prince Vijaya established the Sinhalese kingdom at Tambapanni."
